# Quantized Gradient Projection for Memory-Efficient Continual Learning
This repository contains the implementation for the paper [Quantized Gradient Projection for Memory-Efficient Continual Learning, The Fourteenth International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR 2026)](https://openreview.net/forum?id=xJtxpJ6QdD).


## TL;DR
### We propose QGPM, a memory-efficient and privacy-preserving continual learning framework that compresses task subspaces via quantization.
